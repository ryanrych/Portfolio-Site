Hi, I'm Ryan
I'm a computer science and applied mathematics student at Stony Brook University. I have experience in full stack mobile/web development, IPaaS programming, and algorithms research. I made this site to showcase a collection of my top projects. Enjoy!

Outside of school, I try to stay active. Throughout college I have gotten into playing golf, lifting weights, and I'll join just about any intramural sport available. Apart from this, I'm a big comedy fan so I'll spend time watching any funny Tv Show, YouTube video, or live performance
