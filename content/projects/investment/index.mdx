June 2021

This was a side project I was working on in the summer of 2021. It was a bot that read suggestions from various 
stock/crypto based Twitter accounts and from more reputable sources such as The Motley Fool. It would then 
buy the stock/crypto for a short amount of time, hoping others would follow the suggestion and the value would rise. 
The goal was to run this as a mutual fund that worked soley on getting as many quick buy and sells 
as possible rather than the traditional way of holding in secure assets for long periods of time.<br/><br/>
This was made in Python using Tweepy to read Twitter, Beautiful Soup to read other sites, and Robin Stocks
to buy and sell the stocks and crypto. It was put onto a Raspberry Pi so that it could continuously run.
