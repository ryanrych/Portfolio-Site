This project was given to me and 2 other interns at the beginning of our summer at Next Gen HQ. It was used as a sort of test project so that we could learn the stack and so the development team could see our proficiency. It is a simple social media mobile app that allows users to create profiles with a username, password, and profile picture. Users could create posts with a headline and body and scroll through the timeline of posts made. Each post was clickable and would bring you to the profile page of the user who made it.

This app was made in Typescript using React Native for the front end and Google Firebase for the back end. We also used Expo for deployment.
