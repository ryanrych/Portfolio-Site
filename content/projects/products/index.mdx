This was the first full solo software development project I have ever completed. The product managers 
in the Acurite team of Primex, Family of Companies needed a user friendly application that allowed 
them to search for products by SKU number or by selecting options in multiple categories. There were
also options for users to add, edit, or delete products from the catalog if they had the admin
password.<br/><br/>
I made this desktop app in Java using Java Swing for the front end. Unfortunately a backend couldn't be made
because the company didn't have server space to spare so the products had to be downloaded locally.
