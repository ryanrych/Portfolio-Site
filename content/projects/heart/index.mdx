This was the second app I made during my time contracting for the International Cardiology Consultants. It 
was made for the hospitals in the ICC's Mexico program. Patients fill out the form and based on their answers
a treatment plan is selected.<br/><br/>I made this app using Javascript and React Native. It was deployed to both
the IOS app store and the Google Play store using Expo deployment.
