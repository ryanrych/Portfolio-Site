This was the first time I had ever worked with a real development team. The developers of the My AcuRite app 
wanted to see if Appium would be the right technology to use to run automated tests on the app. To find out, they 
tasked me and the other development intern to write basic automated test cases such as logging in/out, changing theme, 
and navigating the pages of the app.<br/><br/>
This was coded in Java using Appium to automate the test cases.
